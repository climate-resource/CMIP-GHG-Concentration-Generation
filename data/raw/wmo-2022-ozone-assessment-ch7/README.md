The data in this directory was received from the WMO 2022 ozone assessment team.
It is based on data with a usable licence (NOAA and AGAGE), hence is included here.
We also include it here for reproducibility purposes,
as this data is not available in a machine readable form from any other source
(unless we use an automated pdf reader, which we're not going to do right now).
If you would like us to remove this data from the repository,
please [raise an issue](https://github.com/climate-resource/CMIP-GHG-Concentration-Generation/issues/new/choose).
