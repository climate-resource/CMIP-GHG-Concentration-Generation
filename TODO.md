# TODO

- CI
    - run all notebooks
    - check output against some regression output
    - linting (check against Python copier repo to see what makes sense), will need to add in notebook linting with black (although easy as it is just pure Python)
- Use pydoit-nb etc.
- Makefile
    - all
    - checks
    - licence check (but this should be optional in copier)
    - venv
- gitignore
    - ignore *.ipynb
- move upload to zenodo functionality into openscm-zenodo (job for D2)
- commit lock file
- think about pre-commit properly
- check Python copier repo for any other CI stuff
- add create bundle to CI (that should be end of pipeline already so should be automatic)
    - obviously can't/don't want to check upload
- add some advice about always maintaining a test pipeline, even if it means you end up maintaining two config files which can be a bit fiddly
- add advice in development docs about pinning dependencies as this is an application repo (noting also that lock file should save you mostly anyway)
- basic docs (can do this all in README as this is an application not a library)
